## [Socialcops](https://socialcops.com/)

**Issues:** Exploitative Work Culture

- Socialcops is known for its exploitative work culture, with employees working long hours and pulling all-nighters. 
- The company even shared a blog post and image celebrating this culture. 

**Blog Post:**

From their [blog](https://inc42.com/resources/socialcops-culture/):
> Last I checked, it was 3:07 am. Iâ€™ve been working since 11 am yesterday, and Iâ€™ll likely be in the office until 6 am when Iâ€™ll walk home, fall asleep for a few hours, and come back to do it all over again.

> In a company survey, we learned that SocialCops employees pull an average of 5 all-nighters per month and work about 60 hours per week. Our office is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and someone is usually working in the office at any given time, be it a Sunday afternoon or Friday evening.

> Deepu often comes to work at 4 pm and leaves around 5 am. Krishna, another engineer, loves working in long continuous stretches â€” several days straight spent in the office alternating coding and Xbox â€” followed by a full day at home
