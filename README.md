# The Lala List
A list of companies one would not want to touch with a 10ft pole while wearing a Hazmat suit. PRs for new additions are welcome. The list itself is in no particular order.

## Code of Conduct 
- In order to add a company, please Send a PR with company name and public proof of notoriety. 
- Personal grudges, word-of-mouth, arbitrary defamation, and second-hand knowledge would not be considered as enough proof. 
- Proof to be shared in form of screenshots, tweets, archive.is links - anything that is/was a public comment from the company management and is viewable publicly (without logging-in/paywalls). 
- Please do not send screenshots of private conversations and email chains of people simply disgruntled by work or interview processes.

## [Socialcops](https://socialcops.com/)

Unapologetic about exploiting their employees. Convince employees it's okay because "Barack Obama works like this".

> Last I checked, it was 3:07 am. I’ve been working since 11 am yesterday, and I’ll likely be in the office until 6 am when I’ll walk home, fall asleep for a few hours, and come back to do it all over again.

> In a company survey, we learned that SocialCops employees pull an average of 5 all-nighters per month and work about 60 hours per week. Our office is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and someone is usually working in the office at any given time, be it a Sunday afternoon or Friday evening.

> Deepu often comes to work at 4 pm and leaves around 5 am. Krishna, another engineer, loves working in long continuous stretches — several days straight spent in the office alternating coding and Xbox — followed by a full day at home

## [PaySend](https://paysend.com/)

Apparently wants to create a cartel to vilify and blacklist candidates who dare to join another company instead of theirs.

> There is a need of universal database of those candidates who take an offer letter from a company to go shopping around. I am pretty sure all the companies would feed information of such candidates to this database which would help just filter out any one part of this list - https://twitter.com/abhishek_tri/status/1293881125350313986

## [Pristyn Care](https://www.pristyncare.com/)

Makes interviewee go through unnecessary hoops just to see if they're "Special Driven".
>
> 1. Rang the candidate at 8:00am - to request for Interview - Early risers
>
> 2. Schedule telephonic interviews (first round) at 11.00pm - Late workers
>
> 3. Got the candidate to do detailed business case - Real world thinking
>
> 4. Got the candidate to spend 6-8 hours in the office - Culture and patience
>
> 5. Did in person interviews at 9.00 pm - Long working hours
>
> 6. Regularly did Sunday interviews - Extraordinary commitment
>
> 7. For outstation candidates, asked them to show up the next day - Hustle

Spends their time building memes and cheap shots for as simple a thing as someone saying the pricing is higher than what someone can afford (This is despite their existing customers saying the pricing update happened without notice, and they also reneged on previous contracts of lifetime accounts)
